# ECHF-Seg

In the field of medical image segmentation, improving model performance with moderate model parameter becomes an urgent and challenge task. To address this problem, a novel model called ECHF-Seg is proposed in this study, which focuses on the effective convolution and high-frequency enhancement scheme. Two corresponding solutions are Adaptive Decomposed Convolution (ADConv) and Dynamic High-frequency Feature enhancement module (DHF), respectively. Specifically, ADConv achieves a balance between the receptive field and computational overhead by establishing a dynamic mapping between the size of the convolution kernel and the number of channels. In the DHF module, a dynamical Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is included for extracting high-frequency component. In particular, the decomposition level of DWT can be adjusted according to the resolution of the input feature maps. The effectiveness of the proposed ECHF-Seg model is validated through five datasets, which are Glas, BUSI, Kvasir, CVC-ClinicDB, and ISIC 2018. Experimental results show that the proposed ECHF-Seg model can greatly outperform other popular models with moderate model parameter. 


## Experiment
In the experimental section, five publicly available and widely utilized datasets are employed for testing purposes. These datasets are:<br> 
GlaS (gland, with 165 images)<br>
ISIC-2018 (dermoscopy, with 2,594 images)<br>
Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy, with 1,000 images)<br> 
BUSI (breast ultrasound, with 647 images)<br> 
CVC-ClinicDB (colonoscopy, with 612 images)<br>  


In GlaS dataset, we split the dataset into a training set of 85 images and a test set of 80 images. <br>
In ISIC 2018 dataset, we adopt the official split configuration, consisting of a training set with 2,594 images, a validation set with 100 images, and a test set with 1,000 images. <br>
For other dataset, the images are randomly split into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 6:2:2.<br>
The dataset path may look like:
